**Problem 3: House Robber (#198)**
You’re given an integer array nums where each element represents the money in a house along a street.
You cannot rob two adjacent houses because of alarms.
Return the maximum money you can rob without alerting the police.

**State** <br>
dp[i] - represents the max amount robbed ending at house `i` 

**Recurrence**
`dp[i] = max {dp[i-1], (dp[i-2] + h[i])}`

when i is part of the solution, then `dp[i] = dp[i-2] + h[i]` <br>
when i is not part of the solution, then `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`

**Base Case**
dp[0] = h[0]
dp[1] = max {dp[0], dp[1]}

**Return Value**
dp[n-1]
