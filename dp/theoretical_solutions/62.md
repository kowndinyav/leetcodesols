Problem: 🧩 Problem Statement — Unique Paths (#62)

You are given a robot that starts at the top-left corner of an m x n grid.
The robot can only move right or down at any point in time.

Return the total number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

State
dp[i][j] -> represents the count of paths to reach i,j

Recurrence
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

Intuition
total count from top cell and left cell

Base Case
dp[0][*] = 1 -> number of paths to reach a cell in row 1 is always
dp[*][0] = 1 -> number of paths to reach a cell in col 1 is always

Return Value
dp[m-1][n-1]
