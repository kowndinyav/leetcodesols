**🏠 Problem 4 — House Robber II**

You’re given an integer array nums representing money in houses arranged in a circle.
You cannot rob two adjacent houses, and now the first and last house are also adjacent.
Return the maximum money you can rob.


State
dp[i] - represents the max amount robbed ending at house `i` 

Recurrence
dp[i] = max {dp[i-1], (dp[i-2] + h[i])}

when i is part of the solution, then `dp[i] = dp[i-2] + h[i]` <br>
when i is not part of the solution, then `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`

Base Case
dp[0] = h[0]
dp[1] = max {dp[0], dp[1]}

Return Value
dp[n-1]

Additional notes:
We will solve this problem with 2 cases. [0 .. n-1] and [1..n] - pick the max out of these 2

The circle just prevents you from robbing the first and last house together. So we reduce it to two linear House Robber problems, then take the maximum.
