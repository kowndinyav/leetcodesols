Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (#121)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
If no profit is possible, return 0.

Example:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price=1) and sell on day 5 (price=6), profit = 6-1 = 5.



State
dp[i] - represents the left min w.r.t i

Recurrence
dp[i] = min {dp[i-1], a[i-1]}

Intuition
if we know the what is the left min for a corresponding i, profit on that day would be a[i] - dp[i]. above recurrence is checking minimum between previous item in the array vs left min so far. which ever is small, take that and put it in dp[i]

Base Case
dp[0] = a[0]

Return Value
max (a - dp)
