🧩 Problem Statement — Minimum Path Sum (#64)

You are given an m x n grid grid filled with non-negative integers.
The robot starts at the top-left corner (0,0) and can only move right or down.

Return the minimum sum of numbers along a path to reach the bottom-right corner (m-1,n-1).

Example:
Input: grid = [
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]

Output: 7
Explanation: The path 1→3→1→1→1 gives the minimum sum.


State
dp[i][j] -> represents the min cost at i,j

Recurrence
dp[i][j] = cost[i][j] + min {dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]}

Intuition
self explanatory

Base Case
dp[0][*] = cost[0][*]
dp[*][0] = cost[*][0]

Return Value
dp[m-1][n-1]
