**🧩 Problem 2: Min Cost Climbing Stairs (LeetCode #746)**
You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of step i.
Once you pay the cost for a step, you can climb either 1 or 2 steps.

You can start from either step 0 or step 1.
Return the minimum cost to reach the top (beyond the last step).

**DP Definition/Recurrence Relationship**<br>
`dp[i] = min { (cost[i-1] + dp[i-1]), (cost[i-2] + dp[i-2]) }` where <br>
 - cost array is the jump cost from i-1 or i-2 to i
 - dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] represents the cost that took to reach i-1 and i-2

**Base Case** <br>
dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 0 -> This is because, we can start from 1st step or 2nd step to start with

**Return value** <br>
dp[n]
