**Maximum Subarray (#53)**
You are given an integer array nums.
You need to find a contiguous subarray (of length ≥ 1) with the largest sum, and return that sum.


State
dp[i] - represents the max sub array sum ending at i

Recurrence
dp[i] = max {a[i], (dp[i-1] + a[i])}

Intuition
if the max sub ending at i-1 when added with a[i] is one possibility for max sum. This is possible when both are +ve
or, if the sum ending at i-1 is negative, and a[i] is positive, start from i again

Base Case
dp[0] = a[0]


Return Value
max(dp)
