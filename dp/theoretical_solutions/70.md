🧩 Problem Statement — Climbing Stairs (#70)
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.
In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways:
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step


State
dp[i] -> represents distinct ways to jump to ith step

Recurrence
dp[i] = dp[i-2] + dp[i-1]

Intuition
from i-1, if I take one jump (1 step), can reach i
from i-2, if I take one jump (2 steps), can reach i

so it is 2 + what ever distinct ways to reach i-1, i-1

Base Case
dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1

Return Value
dp[n]
