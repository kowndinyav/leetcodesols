🧩 Problem Statement — Unique Paths II (#63)

You are given an m x n grid obstacleGrid where:
	•	obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1 represents an obstacle
	•	obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0 represents a free cell

The robot starts at the top-left corner (0,0) and can only move right or down.

Return the number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1) without stepping on any obstacles.

Example:
Input: obstacleGrid = [
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two paths avoiding the obstacle at (1,1):
1→2→3→6→9
1→4→7→8→9


State
dp[i][j] -> represents count of paths possible at i,j

Recurrence
dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]  when a[i][j-1] == 0 && a[i-1][j] == 0
dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]               when a[i][j-1] == 0 && a[i-1][j] == 1
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]               when a[i][j-1] == 1 && a[i-1][j] == 0

Intuition
If there is obstacle at i-1, j -> we should consider that paths are not possible from that side
If there is obstacle at i, j-1 -> we should consider that paths are not possible from that side
If no obstacle, it sum of both

Base Case
dp[0][*] = 1 except the cells where a[0][*] == 1
dp[*][0] = 1 except the cells where a[*][0] == 1

Return Value
dp[m-1][n-1]
