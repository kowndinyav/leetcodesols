if e != v - 1, then it is not a tree i.e, 
    e < v - 1, graph is disconnect with multiple roots
    e > v - 1, graph is strongly connected with loops

if e = v - 1, then it is a possiblity that it is a tree or disconnected graphs with loops

    A -- B     D - E     (v = 5, e = 4) - an example of e = v - 1 and not a tree
