Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3


1. This is a pattern called "sequence start detection" or another interesting analogy called finding "Snake header and follow till tail"

1   ✅ head (no 0 in set)
2   ❌ has 1 before it
3   ❌ has 2 before it
4   ❌ has 3 before it

100 ✅ head (no 99 in set)
200 ✅ head (no 199 in set)


2. Memory hook image: Imagine your set as a field full of snakes.Your job:

    Find each head (nothing before it).
    Follow it to the tail.
    Track the longest.


Alog
- Create a hashset with numbers
- start iteration
    - if hashset.has(curr - 1) -> not a head, so continue
    - else, it is head -> loop until curr + 1 is present in the hashset and keep track of seq length
