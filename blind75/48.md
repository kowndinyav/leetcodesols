rotate matrix by 90

## My solution

Shift items in the following order

(T,L) -> (T, R)
(T,R) -> (B, R)
(B,R) -> (L, B)
(L,B) -> (L, T)

Above shifting needs to be done for each layer (Essentially each layer the width reduces by 2)
N - 1 
N - 3 
N - 5

How many such layers - N/2

High level logic

for each_layer (N/2) {

    for num_shift_iterations (N - layer*2) {

        TEMP = matrix[L][T]

        Loop 1: (T,L) -> (T, R)
        Loop 2: (T,R) -> (B, R)
        Loop 3: (B,R) -> (L, B)
        Loop 4: (L,B) -> (L, T)

    }

    matrix[L][T + 1] = TEMP

    L++, T++, R--, B--
}

## insight based solution

If 90 degree right rotation
- transpose (rows become columns)
- reverse items in each row

If 90 degree left rotation
- transpose (rows become columns)
- reverse items in each column
