Graph Valid Tree

You have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph. Return true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.\


Foundational principles:
- (Edges > Vertices - 1) -> Well connected graph with loops
- (Edges < Vertices - 1) -> Graph with disconnected components
- (Edges == Vertices - 1)
    Can potentially be a tree but sometimes may not be. An example of (Edges == Vertices - 1) and not a tree is


         1
        / \
       3---2

       4   (isolated)

    Here there 3 edges and 4 vertices but not a tree - it is a combination of a loop and disconnected component


Intuition:

- if e != v-1 -> not a tree

- else
{
    start with some random node and do a BFS

    if any vertex is revisited -> return false

    at the end of BFS, if the visited count == vertices it is tree
}
