3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters. 

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


Solution:
- Have a memory of Left to Right without repetition
- Once a repeated character found, movel Left by +1 to repeated character
    - Catch: Left should be incremented by only if the repeated character's position > current Left
    - Example case: abba -> where last a when it repeats, it should not reset Left to 1 again from Left = 2
