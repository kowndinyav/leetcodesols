Longest Consecutive Sequence

- First create a hashset of all the numbers so that look up is easy

Thinking:
- A number in the hashset can be 
    - the smallest of the sequence
    - not the smallest
    - only one in sequence

- if the number is smallest, then hash.get(num-1) should be false
- else, go till you find num+1, track max
