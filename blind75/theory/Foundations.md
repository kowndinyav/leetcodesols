Foundational principles:
- (Edges > Vertices - 1) -> Well connected graph with loops
- (Edges < Vertices - 1) -> Graph with disconnected components
- (Edges == Vertices - 1)
    Can potentially be a tree but sometimes may not be. An example of (Edges == Vertices - 1) and not a tree is


         1
        / \
       3---2

       4   (isolated)

    Here there 3 edges and 4 vertices but not a tree - it is a combination of a loop and disconnected component
