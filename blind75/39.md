- to avoid duplicate solutions, for loop should be starting from (START) and not (0) always

    CORRECT: for (let i = START;i< n ; i++)
    WRONG: for (let i = 0;i< n ; i++)

- solution array must be popped after the function call
    sol.push(candidates[i])
        solve(i, target - candidates[i], sol)
    sol.pop()

- create a clone/copy of the array at the time of pushing the solution array into final list
    [...sol]
