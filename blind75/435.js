/*
Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need 
to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.
