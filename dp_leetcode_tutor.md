If I gave you a NEW DP problem, could you follow these same 7 steps?
    Write brute force recursion
    Notice repeated subproblems
    Define what dp[i] means
    Derive the formula from recursion
    Figure out base cases
    Determine fill order (dependencies)
    Write the bottom-up code

1. Brute force recursion
2. Identify overlapping subproblems
3. Define DP state
4. Derive formula from recursion
5. Base cases
6. Fill order
7. Implement bottom-up
