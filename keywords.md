## ⚡ Common triggers and what they suggest

Here are some examples of keywords → triggered approach:

- “Longest substring / subsequence” → sliding window, DP.
- “Kth largest / smallest” → heap, quickselect, binary search on answer.
- “Intervals” → sorting + greedy, or sweep line.
- “Connected components / islands / groups” → DFS, BFS, Union-Find.
- “Anagrams / permutations” → hash maps, sorting, frequency arrays.
- “Prefix / suffix sums” → running sum, difference arrays.
- “Cyclic / repeated pattern” → modulo, Floyd’s cycle detection.
- “Monotonic” → stack, binary search, two pointers.
- “Minimize max / maximize min” → binary search on answer, greedy.
