✅ 3. “Interview Insights Notebook” (your personal cheat-code)

Create a simple Notion / Google Doc with these sections:

⸻

A. My mental models

Examples you will fill in:
	•	Consistency spectrum (strong → eventual → CRDTs)
	•	Cache patterns (write-through, write-behind, refresh-ahead)
	•	Latency budgets
	•	Backpressure in distributed systems
	•	Idempotency patterns

⸻

B. Company Stories (short bullets)

Each company gets a page with 5 bullets:

Example (Netflix):
	•	Moved from monolith → microservices to improve velocity
	•	Built Hystrix for fault isolation
	•	EVCache to handle personalized workloads
	•	Chaos Monkey → resilience culture
	•	Edge and control planes are fully separate

This helps you drop impressive lines in interviews.

⸻

C. Must-know architectures

Each gets 10–12 bullet summary:
	•	Dynamo
	•	Spanner
	•	Kafka
	•	Snowflake
	•	Delta Lake

These are powerful:
	•	“How Amazon designed for failures at massive scale”
	•	“Why Uber needed Cadence and how it works”
	•	“Why Cloudflare rewrote their proxy to Pingora”
	•	“How Spanner achieves global consistency with TrueTime”

You will stand out instantly.

⸻

E. My unique insights

Every time you learn something cool, add one line here.
After 2 months, this will become your signature knowledge base.

⸻

If you want, I can create the first version of this notebook for you automatically.
Just say:

“Create the interview insights notebook for me.”
